# Consumer

Consumer's main task is to process incoming messages by given function.

See the [consumer.js](consumer.js) script to understand how to use it.

## Consumer class

Is an abstract class, from which you should derive your own consumers.
Similarly as when creating publisher, you must pass Connection instance and a prepare function to constructor.
Prepare function is called whenever the new instance is created and when auto-reconnect is done.

On every connection auto-reconnect the prepare function of consumer is called, then the consume function is called too, so you do not have to bother with manual consumption regeneration after failures. 

## Custom Consumer
You can extend basic Consumer class to create your own consumer classes.
You can see the example of custom consumer is in [CustomConsumer.js](CustomConsumer.js).

Every custom consumer must implement processMessage(msg, channel) function.
In this function you can do whatever you want with the message and ack/nack/reject it via channel as you wish.

## Example

Run : `$ node consumer.js`

In output log you should see lines _(your consumption tags will differ)_:
```
Started consuming queue "source-simple-queue". Consumption tag: amq.ctag-8LSFBz973CA2DT-U1xToDA
Started consuming queue "source-custom-queue". Consumption tag: amq.ctag-h4c16EBm76NxHFA7ti7bTQ
```

You can publish any message to _source-simple-queue_ or _source-custom-queue_ and it will be process by SimpleConsumer or CustomConsumer.
